        Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being
        outdoors. In the winter, I am an avid skiier and novice ice climber.
        During the warmer months here in Colorado, I enjoy mountain biking, free
        climbing, and kayaking.

        When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre
        movies and television shows, I am an aspiring chef, and I spend a large
        amount of my free time exploring the latest technolgy advancements in
        the front-end web development world.
